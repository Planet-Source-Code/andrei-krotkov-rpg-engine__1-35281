### Description

This code is an engine for an RPG engine. It has a battle system (it woirks, but is not the best), a shop system with 3 items to buy, handles messages, can ask yes/no questions, if statements, and many other things. This engine comes with a very simple game, where you have to rescue a princess by battleing a dragon. Includes very unefficient level editor, but it works. Make sure to use WinZip so the directories remain intact.
 
### More Info
 
Extract with WinZip so directories are intact.
